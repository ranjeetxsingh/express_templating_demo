# express_templating_demo
Learning how to do templating using express and ejs. Also we have learned about partials - include function where we do not need to write the same code again and again for the same page


!!! important !!!
Be sure to use express before executing files , because node_modules package of express isn't included with this.

run this on your gitBash or command Line whatever :-
// npm i express
